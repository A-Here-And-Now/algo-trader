Absolutely — the **Turtle Trading strategy** is one of the most famous trading experiments in history, and it’s a great case study in systematic trading.

# 🐢 **The Turtle Trading Story**

* In the 1980s, **Richard Dennis**, a successful commodities trader, believed that *trading could be taught* like a set of rules, not just an innate talent.
* His partner, **William Eckhardt**, disagreed and thought good traders had unique intuition.
* To settle the bet, Dennis trained a group of people with little or no trading experience — they became the **“Turtles”**.
* Using his systematic strategy, many Turtles went on to make millions and manage funds.

# ⚙️ **How the Turtle System Works**

The Turtles followed **strict rules** — mechanical, no guessing.
The rules were trend-following but focused on **breakouts from consolidation**.

---

## 1. **Markets**

* Turtles traded a **diverse portfolio**: commodities, currencies, bonds, stock indices.
* Idea: more diversification = more chances to catch big trends.

---

## 2. **Entry Rules**

They used **Donchian Channel breakouts**:

* **System 1 (short-term):** Buy when price breaks above the **20-day high**; sell/short when it breaks below the **20-day low**.
* **System 2 (longer-term):** Same logic, but on the **55-day breakout**.

👉 Example:
If gold closes today above its last 20 days’ highest price → **enter long position**.

## 3. **Position Sizing (the famous “N” rule)**

Risk management was *the heart* of the system:

* **N = ATR (Average True Range)** = a measure of volatility.
* Position size was adjusted so that each trade risked about **1–2% of capital**.

  * Example: If N = $1.50 and you allow $1,000 risk per trade, you size position as ≈ $1,000 / $1.50 ≈ 666 units.

This way, volatility determined position size (smaller positions in volatile markets, bigger in calmer markets).

---

## 4. **Adding to Winners (“Pyramiding”)**

* If a trade moved in their favor by **+0.5N**, they would add another unit.
* They could pyramid up to 4 units, scaling in as the trend continued.
* This let them ride *massive* trends with big exposure, but only after the trade had proven itself.

---

## 5. **Exits**

* **System 1:** Exit long when price falls below the **10-day low** (or short when above 10-day high).
* **System 2:** Exit long when price falls below the **20-day low** (opposite for shorts).
* Always exit on stop rules — no discretionary overrides.

---

## 6. **Risk Management**

* Never risk more than **2% of capital** on one trade.
* Never risk more than a set % (like 20%) across all correlated markets.
* Diversify across asset classes to avoid getting whipsawed in one sector.

---

# 📈 **Why It Worked**

* In the 1980s, futures and commodities often trended strongly (e.g., currencies post–Bretton Woods, commodity cycles).
* The Turtles didn’t predict — they *reacted to breakouts*.
* The strict position sizing let them survive inevitable losing streaks.

---

# ⚠️ **Limitations**

* The strategy is **pure trend-following**.
* It suffers in **sideways/choppy markets** (lots of false breakouts, “whipsaws”).
* In modern markets, raw Turtle rules don’t perform as well (markets are more efficient, transaction costs matter more).
* Still, the principles (systematic rules, volatility-based sizing, diversification, discipline) remain highly influential.

# 🔑 **Core Lessons**

1. Trading can be systematic, not purely intuition.
2. Risk sizing (volatility-adjusted) matters more than entry signal.
3. Pyramiding into *proven winners* is powerful in long trends.
4. Discipline is the edge — stick to rules, don’t override emotionally.

---

👉 So in summary: **The Turtles bought breakouts, sized positions by volatility, added to winners, and cut losers quickly.**

Do you want me to show you a **code sketch of the Turtle entry/exit rules** (say in Python or Go) so you can see how it would actually look in an algorithm?
